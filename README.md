# Graphic-Repo
Repo For Misc Graphics

I am only uploading a fairly straight forward interactive graph of some covid-19 numbers to test and play with as I figure out how to upload
to a server/web app for easier sharing.

Once that is figured out I plan to expand the number of graphs, types of analysis, and functionality depending on what is allowable for the apps
I deploy. 

Stay tuned for more updates :)
